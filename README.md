# ML Journey

Welcome to my ML Journey repository! Here, I document the machine learning projects I've worked on and share my progress and insights in the field.

## Project 1: How much would that car cost?
Brief description of the first project. Include what the project aimed to achieve, the dataset used, and key outcomes.
This is a project/report that i did in R markdown for statistics course in university that its main goal was to create a model to predict car prices.
It involves Data Cleaning,Exploratory Data Analysis,Data Visualization,Basic Statistical Analysis,Data Preprocessing,Machine Learning(simple models like linear regression or decision trees),Model Evaluation,Feature Engineering and etc.
### Results

By doing this project I learned how to work with real life and apply statistical methods to real life data.
